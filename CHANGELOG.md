## [v2.2.0] — 2026-05-08

### Features
- **Forgot password** — Login page "Forgot Password" opens a dialog to reset password inline (email lookup + new password form). Uses per-user salt for new password hash
- **Data import** — Settings tab now has "Import Data" button alongside Export. Parses JSON backup, validates structure, merges with deduplication
- **Password hashing (per-user salt)** — `hashPassword` now accepts a per-user random 16-byte hex salt. Old users with static salt are auto-migrated on login. Plaintext password fallback preserved for pre-migration accounts
- **Admin panel security** — Admin access now requires both email match AND `role === "admin"`. Added security note about server-side verification in production
- **`<html lang>` init script** — Added inline `<script>` in `<head>` that reads stored language preference from localStorage before first paint, eliminating flash of wrong language for English users
- **XSS sanitization** — `MarkdownRenderer` now sanitizes HTML output via DOMPurify (client-side) or regex fallback (SSR), preventing script injection in comments, bios, and README content

### Bug Fixes

---

## [v2.1.1] — 2026-05-08

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **Dark mode broken** — `:root body` light gradient had same specificity as `.dark body` and appeared later in cascade, always overriding dark styles. Fixed by using `:root:not(.dark)` for all light-mode-only selectors (`:root`, `:root .glass-card`, `:root .glass-card-hover:hover`, `:root body`)
- **Onboarding tooltip empty box** — Step 2/3 showed an invisible box because `positionTooltip` silently returned when target element IDs were off-screen. Added `scrollIntoView` + `requestAnimationFrame` for reliable positioning, and a center-screen fallback when elements not found
- **Toast hardcoded colors** — Replaced `#00d4ff`, `#8b949e`, `text-white` with theme tokens (`text-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`, `text-foreground`) so toasts are readable in both themes

### Bug Fixes
- **Avatar crop dialog** — `getContext("2d")!` non-null assertion could cause promise to hang forever if canvas unavailable. Added proper null check with reject. Added error logging instead of silent catch
- **Navbar keyboard nav** — Arrow key navigation in "more" dropdown could crash with `% 0` modulo when menu items list was empty. Added `items.length === 0` guard
- **Notification bell focus** — `activeIdx` could exceed `items.length` after notifications were deleted while menu was open. Added bounds check

---

### Bug Fixes
- **`error.tsx` deprecated API** — `unstable_retry` replaced with `reset()` (Next.js 16 breaking change)

- **Prompt Playground `{var}` fix** — `buildPrompt` now replaces both `{{var}}` and `{var}` formats; previously `{var}` variables were detected but never substituted
- **Sitemap agent categories** — Added agent skill category entries (`/skills?category=...`) to sitemap generation

- **Skills/Prompts filtering fully memoized** — `filtered` results now wrapped in `useMemo` with proper dependency arrays; prevents re-filtering on every render
- **Trending page data memoized** — `allItems`, `filtered`, `sorted`, `list` all wrapped in `useMemo`; eliminates redundant sorting on unrelated state changes

## [v1.9.0] — 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- **My Likes/Favorites tab now shows Agent Skills** — Previously only Prompt skills were resolved; Agent skill IDs silently disappeared. Both tabs now render `AgentSkillCard` and `SkillCard` separately
- **My Comments delete now syncs skillComments** — Deleting a comment from the profile now also removes it from the per-skill `skillComments` localStorage key, so the skill detail page no longer shows orphaned comments
- **Usage History links now route correctly** — Agent skill view/copy history items now link to `/skills/[id]` instead of always linking to `/prompts/[id]`
- **`formatNumber()` handles millions** — `1000000` now shows "1M" instead of "1000.0k"
- **`formatDate()` parses dot-separated dates** — `"2026.04"` format (used in mock data) is now normalized to ISO before parsing, fixing "Invalid Date" errors
- **Skills/Prompts `setRefresh` actually works** — `useMemo` dependency array now includes `refresh` counter, so newly created skills/prompts appear without manual page reload
- **Agent skill card install command no longer triggers navigation** — Added `e.stopPropagation()` so clicking the install command copies to clipboard without also navigating to the detail page
- **GitHub import modal no longer shows form + spinner simultaneously** — Parsing state now hides the form input, preventing visual overlap
- **Sitemap uses real lastUpdated dates** — Agent skill pages now use `s.lastUpdated` instead of `new Date()` (always "today"); prompt date parsing is more robust
- **Sitemap base URL from env var** — `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` env var now overrides the hardcoded Vercel URL

### Changed
- **Profile tabs use URL search params** — `?tab=settings` deep-linking now works; refreshing the page preserves the active tab. Tabs use `useSearchParams` + `router.replace`
- **Profile tabs have ARIA tab roles** — `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`, `tabIndex` management
- **Skill detail tabs have ARIA roles** — Same ARIA tab pattern applied to the 3-tab layout (intro/files/feedback)
- **Breadcrumb i18n** — "Home" label now uses `t.common.home`; last item has `aria-current="page"`; decorative chevron has `aria-hidden="true"`
- **Scroll-to-top button i18n** — `aria-label` now uses `t.common.backToTop` instead of hardcoded English
- **Loading skeleton a11y** — Added `role="status"`, `aria-busy="true"`, `aria-label`
- **Error boundary icons** — `AlertTriangle` decorative icons now have `aria-hidden="true"`
- **Login page loading state** — Submit button shows "..." while authenticating; error message has `role="alert"`
- **Register page confirm password** — New "Confirm Password" field with mismatch validation
- **Register page loading state** — Submit button shows "..." while registering; error message has `role="alert"`
- **i18n keys added** — `common.backToTop`, `auth.confirmPassword`, `auth.confirmPasswordPlaceholder`, `auth.passwordMismatch`

### Files Modified
- `src/components/profile/my-likes-tab.tsx` — Import `getAgentSkillById` + `AgentSkillCard`; render both agent and prompt skills
- `src/components/profile/my-favorites-tab.tsx` — Same dual-render pattern
- `src/components/profile/my-comments-tab.tsx` — `handleDelete` now accepts `skillId` and cleans up `skillComments` storage

- `src/lib/utils.ts` — `formatNumber` handles M; `formatDate` normalizes dot-separated dates

- `src/app/prompts/client.tsx` — Same `useMemo` fix
- `src/components/agent-skill/agent-skill-card.tsx` — `e.stopPropagation()` + `.catch()` on clipboard
- `src/components/skills/create-from-github.tsx` — Form hidden during parsing state

- **4-column grid on xl screens** — skill cards, featured section, and homepage category cards now show 4 columns on 1440px+ screens (`xl:grid-cols-4`)
- **Table hydration fix** — MarkdownRenderer table rows now wrapped in `<thead>` and `<tbody>` to match browser DOM tree, eliminating React hydration warning
- **MarkdownRenderer rewrite** — Skill detail page README now renders properly: table separator rows (`|---|`) are skipped, tables render as `<table>` with header distinction, inline `**bold**` and `` `code` `` formatting processed in bullet points and numbered lists, not just in paragraphs
- **Agent Skill category system** — New `agent-skill-categories.ts` with 8 independent categories (Skills管理, Web开发, Web搜索, 多平台交互, 代码执行, 文件处理, 通讯协作, 数据分析); `skills/client.tsx` now uses the centralized category definitions instead of a hardcoded array
- **Homepage dual-category** — `CategoryCards` now dynamically shows Agent Skill categories or Prompt categories based on the active Tab; grid adapts to 4 columns for Agent (8 categories) vs 3 for Prompt (6 categories)
- **Tab state lifted** — `FeaturedSection` and `CategoryCards` now share tab state via `page.tsx`, so switching tabs updates both the card grid and the category section simultaneously
- **URL category filter** — `/skills?category=Web开发` now auto-selects the matching category filter on page load

### Files Modified
- `src/app/skills/[id]/client.tsx` — Full MarkdownRenderer rewrite: `InlineMarkdown` helper, `isTableSeparator` detection, table flush/render with `<table>` element
- `src/app/skills/client.tsx` — Uses `agentSkillCategories` from shared file, reads `category` query param via `useSearchParams()`
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Lifts `tab` state, passes to `FeaturedSection` and `CategoryCards`
- `src/components/home/featured-section.tsx` — Accepts `tab`/`onTabChange` props instead of managing own state
- `src/components/home/category-cards.tsx` — Accepts `tab` prop, renders `agentSkillCategories` or `categories` accordingly, uses 4-col grid on lg for Agent
