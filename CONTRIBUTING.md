## How to Contribute

### Submit Skill Templates (Most Welcome!)

This is the simplest and most valuable way to contribute:

1. Use the "Submit Template" feature directly on the website
2. Or fork this repo, add a new Skill object in `src/lib/mock-data.ts`, and submit a PR

#### Skill Template Requirements

Each template must include:

- **Title**: Clear description of functionality, with version number (e.g., `v2.1`)
- **Subtitle**: One-line description, no more than 50 characters
- **Online Prompt**: For ChatGPT / Claude / Grok and similar platforms
- **Local Prompt**: For LM Studio / Ollama and similar local tools
- **Variable Definitions**: Variables the user needs to fill in (e.g., `{{topic}}`)
- **Before/After Example**: At least one real input/output comparison
- **Recommended Models**: Note recommended models and their use cases
- **Usage Steps**: Separate instructions for online and local usage

#### Quality Standards

- Prompts must be tested on at least 2 different models
- Output should be natural and free of obvious AI-sounding text
- Cover real productivity scenarios, not just demos

### Report Bugs

Submit bug reports in [Issues](../../issues), including:

- Problem description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior vs. actual behavior
- Browser and operating system information
